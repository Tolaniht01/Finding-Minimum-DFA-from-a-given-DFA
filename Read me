You will be given the input in a matrix form.  
Where M is transition matrix of (2t+1) * t size, defined as similar to the other programs. The first row represents the final row, next t rows corresponding to input alphabet 0 and last t rows are for alphabet 1. 


You take the matrix and write a C program to find the equivalent minimum size automata. 

Your output must be in the form of t1$M1 where t1 is the number of states in the minimized DFA and M1 is the matrix of size (2*t1 + 1) * t1

The first row represents final states. The rest of the matrix represents the transition matrix of minimized DFA with first t1 rows for alphabet 0 and last t1 rows for alphabet 1. 

You can label the states of the new DFA in any fashion, but the start state must be the 0th state. 


How to test the correctness of your program:

1. In your program, you must read input from file "input.txt" and should create and output file with name "output.txt"
     Please follow the same format. 
2. Keep your .c file in folder name with 'auto grade'
3. Run test.py from terminal from the same folder
4. If it returns "Ture" your output is correct.
   If it returns "False", something wrong with your program, correct it.
